Images are not appearing because they were hotlinked from HLTV.org, but they are recoverable. All of them are listed in the image-links.txt file, which contains thousands of hotlinks. However, Cloudflare prevents automatic downloading of CDN images directly from HLTV.org.

## Overview

Dust2.se was a beloved news and community hub dedicated to the Swedish Counterâ€‘Strike scene. On 31 October 2024, HLTV announced that Dust2.se would close permanently, knowing this information, the site was preserved to prevent its articles, interviews, and community discussions from becoming lost media, almost all publicly available pages and assets (except images) have been scraped and are hosted here for posterity.
## Background

On 31 October 2024, Dust2.se published the following message (in Swedish):

> "Dust2 upphÃ¶r med sin verksamhet - HejdÃ¥ Sverige - FÃ¶r ett Ã¥r sedan vÃ¤lkomnade vi er till Dust2.se med stora fÃ¶rhoppningar och drÃ¶mmar om framtiden. Idag kommer vi tyvÃ¤rr stÃ¤nga ner hemsidan och avbryta allt vi hade planerat till framtiden."

In English:

> "Dust2 is ceasing operations - Goodbye Sweden - A year ago, we welcomed you to Dust2.se with high hopes and dreams for the future. Today, unfortunately, we will shut down the website and cancel all our future plans."

With the official site now offline, this archive ensures that the voices, stories, and history captured by Dust2.se remain accessible.

## Overview

Dust2.se was a beloved news and community hub dedicated to the Swedish Counterâ€‘Strike scene. On 31 October 2024, the site owners announced that Dust2.se would close permanently, leaving behind a trove of articles, interviews, and community discussions now at risk of disappearing forever.

This repository is a communityâ€‘driven effort to preserve Dust2.se as lost media. All publicly available pages and assets have been scraped and are hosted here for posterity. Whether you came for the classic match reports, player interviews, or community editorials, you can find it all in this archive.

## Background

On 31 October 2024, Dust2.se published the following message (in Swedish):

> "Dust2 upphÃ¶r med sin verksamhet - HejdÃ¥ Sverige - FÃ¶r ett Ã¥r sedan vÃ¤lkomnade vi er till Dust2.se med stora fÃ¶rhoppningar och drÃ¶mmar om framtiden. Idag kommer vi tyvÃ¤rr stÃ¤nga ner hemsidan och avbryta allt vi hade planerat till framtiden."

In English:

> "Dust2 is ceasing operations - Goodbye Sweden - A year ago, we welcomed you to Dust2.se with high hopes and dreams for the future. Today, unfortunately, we will shut down the website and cancel all our future plans."

With the official site now offline, this archive ensures that the voices, stories, and history captured by Dust2.se remain accessible.
